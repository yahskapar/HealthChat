# <img src="./figures/title_icon.png" alt="HealthChat Icon" width="25" /> HealthChat-11K

This repository contains the official code to reconstruct **HealthChat-11K**, a curated dataset of approx. 11,000 real-world conversations where users seek healthcare information from Large Language Models (LLMs). The goal of this work is to provide a high-quality resource for systematically studying and improving health conversations involving humans and AI (e.g., LLMs). **HealthChat-11K** corresponds to an arXiv paper - ["What's Up, Doc?": Analyzing How Users Seek Health Information in Large-Scale Conversational AI Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21532).

This codebase fetches conversational data from large-scale source datasets and merges it with our detailed annotations to produce the final, ready-to-use dataset.

## üìù Project Status

- [x] Release `v1.0.0` of the master annotations and dataset artifacts generation script.
- [ ] Complete additional, minor taxonomy revisions and update master annotations.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Composition

The final dataset is a composition of three parts: two large-scale source datasets and our own layer of annotations. The script in this repository automates the process of combining them.

1.  **Source Datasets (The Raw Text):** Our conversations are filtered from two public datasets:
    * [lmsys/lmsys-chat-1m](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lmsys/lmsys-chat-1m)
    * [allenai/WildChat-1M](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/WildChat-1M)

2.  **HealthChat Annotations (Our Contribution):** We provide a master annotation file containing our core analysis, including a clinician-driven taxonomy, specialty classifications, and sycophancy analysis. This file is hosted on the Hugging Face Hub:
    * [yahskapar/HealthChat-11K](https://huggingface.co/datasets/yahskapar/HealthChat-11K)

3.  **Final Dataset (The Output):** The script in this repo uses our annotations file to pull the correct conversations from the source datasets and generate the final, merged `HealthChat-11K_v1.0.0.jsonl` file.

## üîß Setup

This project uses Conda for environment management. The following steps will create a clean environment and install all necessary dependencies.

**STEP 1: Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yahskapar/HealthChat.git
cd HealthChat
```

**STEP 2: Run the setup script**
This will create a `healthchat` conda environment with Python 3.13 and install the required packages.
```bash
bash setup.sh
```

**STEP 3: Activate the environment**
```bash
conda activate healthchat
```

## üíª Generating HealthChat-11K

Once the setup is complete, you can generate the full `HealthChat-11K` dataset and the accompanying review files by running the main script.

```bash
python generate_artifacts.py
```

This will perform the following steps:
1.  Download the master annotation file (`v1.0.0`) from the Hugging Face Hub.
2.  Stream the source datasets (`lmsys-chat-1m` and `WildChat-1M`) to find the required conversations.
3.  Merge the source data with the annotations.
4.  Save all generated files into a new directory named **`HealthChat-11K_v1.0.0_artifacts/`**.

This output directory will contain:
* `HealthChat-11K_v1.0.0.jsonl`: The final, complete dataset.
* `HealthChat-11K_v1.0.0_full_review.csv`: A CSV with every conversation turn for review.
* `HealthChat-11K_v1.0.0_sycophancy_review.csv`: A CSV with leading questions seeking treatment (LQST) annotations marked for review.
